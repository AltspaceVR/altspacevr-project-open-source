# AltspaceVR Project - Existing Open Source

## Instructions

Link to an open source project that you have created or significantly contributed to, describe the work, and discuss possible additions. You must have contributed more than 100 lines of code to the project.

## Goals

[Our projects](http://altspacevr.github.io/altspacevr-projects/) have been our best tool in determining which candidates will be successful at AltspaceVR, but we recognize that everyone may not have the time to complete them. As an alternative, we offer the opportunity to candidates who have made significant open source contributions to leverage that code in lieu of a normal project.

We use this project to get a sense of your coding style, experience, and your ability to creatively extend your work.

# Part 1 - Describe what you’ve done

Please write your reason for working on the project and describe the direct contributions you made, including:
- Your GitHub username
- A link to the repo where your work can be seen
- Any relevant files, commits, or line number ranges
- Why you worked on this project

# Part 2 - Explore theoretical enhancements

Please describe a few theoretical enhancements and new use-cases for the project, including:
- A way you could improve the architecture or code structure
- A new piece of functionality that would be useful
- How this project could be used at AltspaceVR (you might have to get creative for certain projects!)

## Deliverable

E-mail us a PDF file with the above content to `project@altvr.com`. Please include your contact information, and if you haven't submitted it to us already, your resume and cover letter. 

We can’t wait to see what you’ve done!
